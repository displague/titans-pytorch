# Implemented ledger policy

- Keep entries timestamped as `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`.
- Summarize what changed and why, including hypothesis/outcome interpretation when relevant.
- Include validation commands and key metrics/artifacts for reproducibility.
- Record superseded or rerun experiment tags when results are replaced.
- Keep entries concise and grep-friendly.
