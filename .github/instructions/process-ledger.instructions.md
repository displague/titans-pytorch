# Process ledger policy

- Keep entries timestamped as `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`.
- Keep `TODO.md` focused on active/planned items and explicit hypotheses.
- Include expected toggle plan plus success/failure interpretation signals.
- Move completed entries to `IMPLEMENTED.md` with outcomes and evidence.
- Prefer concise, machine-diff-friendly bullet lists over prose blocks.
