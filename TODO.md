# TODO

## Active
- [2026-02-08 17:16:41] Add long-horizon drift benchmark (phase consistency and recovery after perturbation).
- [2026-02-08 17:16:41] Prototype manifold-state keyed cache lookup policy in `NeuralMemory` state.
- [2026-02-08 17:16:41] Add ablation script for gate variants (`hard`, `soft`, `top_k`, adaptive top-k, phase mix).

## Future Directions
- [2026-02-08 17:16:41] Add calibration sweep for `symplectic_page_threshold` to target switch-rate bands.
- [2026-02-08 17:16:41] Add CI regression guard that diffs latest benchmark JSON against rolling baseline.

## Process Notes
- Completed items move to `IMPLEMENTED.md` with timestamps and test evidence.
