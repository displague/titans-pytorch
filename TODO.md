# TODO

## Active
- [2026-02-08 17:38:45] Add CI regression guard that diffs latest benchmark JSON against a rolling baseline.
- [2026-02-08 17:38:45] Evaluate `manifold_state_keyed_paging` against threshold-step paging on long-horizon and interference tasks.
- [2026-02-08 17:38:45] Convert threshold sweep output into documented recommended switch-rate bands.

## Future Directions
- [2026-02-08 17:23:12] Advanced next-next topic: Renormalization-Group Memory Ladder (multiscale coarse-graining + refinement).
- Parallels:
- Cosmology: scale-dependent structure growth and horizon crossing.
- Quantum physics / QFT: RG flow and effective theories by scale.
- String theory: worldsheet beta flow and scale consistency constraints.
- Statistics: hierarchical shrinkage / partial pooling across resolutions.
- Topology: persistent homology across filtration scales.
- Language theory: hierarchy from local syntax to discourse-level constraints.
- Fusion research: turbulence cascades and confinement across scales.
- [2026-02-08 17:38:45] Expand cross-field inspiration set for new experimental hypotheses:
- Neuroscience: predictive coding, hippocampal replay, attractor consolidation.
- Social psychology: context framing, priming persistence, group-level interference analogs.
- Linear algebra: low-rank + sparse decompositions, orthogonality control, spectral conditioning.

## Process Notes
- Completed items move to `IMPLEMENTED.md` with timestamps and test evidence.
