# TODO

## Active
- [2026-02-08 17:23:12] Prototype manifold-state keyed cache lookup policy in `NeuralMemory` state.
- [2026-02-08 17:23:12] Add ablation script for gate variants (`hard`, `soft`, `top_k`, adaptive top-k, phase mix).

## Future Directions
- [2026-02-08 17:16:41] Add calibration sweep for `symplectic_page_threshold` to target switch-rate bands.
- [2026-02-08 17:16:41] Add CI regression guard that diffs latest benchmark JSON against rolling baseline.
- [2026-02-08 17:23:12] Advanced next-next topic: Renormalization-Group Memory Ladder (multiscale coarse-graining + refinement).
- Parallels:
- Cosmology: scale-dependent structure growth and horizon crossing.
- Quantum physics / QFT: RG flow and effective theories by scale.
- String theory: worldsheet beta flow and scale consistency constraints.
- Statistics: hierarchical shrinkage / partial pooling across resolutions.
- Topology: persistent homology across filtration scales.
- Language theory: hierarchy from local syntax to discourse-level constraints.
- Fusion research: turbulence cascades and confinement across scales.

## Process Notes
- Completed items move to `IMPLEMENTED.md` with timestamps and test evidence.
