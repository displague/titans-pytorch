# TODO

## Active
- [2026-02-08 17:38:45] Evaluate `manifold_state_keyed_paging` against threshold-step paging on long-horizon and interference tasks.
- [2026-02-08 17:38:45] Convert threshold sweep output into documented recommended switch-rate bands.
- [2026-02-08 17:55:14] Wire `benchmarks/check_regression.py` into CI with a checked-in rolling baseline artifact policy.

## Future Directions
- [2026-02-08 17:23:12] Advanced next-next topic: Renormalization-Group Memory Ladder (multiscale coarse-graining + refinement).
- Parallels:
- Cosmology: scale-dependent structure growth and horizon crossing.
- Quantum physics / QFT: RG flow and effective theories by scale.
- String theory: worldsheet beta flow and scale consistency constraints.
- Statistics: hierarchical shrinkage / partial pooling across resolutions.
- Topology: persistent homology across filtration scales.
- Language theory: hierarchy from local syntax to discourse-level constraints.
- Fusion research: turbulence cascades and confinement across scales.
- [2026-02-08 17:38:45] Expand cross-field inspiration set for new experimental hypotheses:
- Neuroscience: predictive coding, hippocampal replay, attractor consolidation.
- Social psychology: context framing, priming persistence, group-level interference analogs.
- Linear algebra: low-rank + sparse decompositions, orthogonality control, spectral conditioning.
- [2026-02-08 17:58:10] Next next-next inspiration pool for cross-field experimental hypotheses:
- Microbiology: colony dynamics, quorum-like signaling, and resilience under stress.
- Genetics: regulatory circuits, expression gating, mutation/selection style search over gating policies.
- Chemistry: reaction kinetics and equilibrium analogs for memory update vs decay balance.
- Taste/odor detection: combinatorial receptor coding and sparse mixture separation.
- Taxonomy science: hierarchical class structure and stable branch-specific specialization.
- Information theory: bottleneck trade-offs, coding efficiency, and surprise-driven switching.
- Economic theory: resource allocation, market equilibrium, and incentive-compatible routing.

## Process Notes
- Completed items move to `IMPLEMENTED.md` with timestamps and test evidence.
